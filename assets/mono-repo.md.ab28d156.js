Or for small projects, a simpler alternative is to attach your projects to the main <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/main/ServiceStack/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceStack.sln</a> where most ServiceStack projects are readably available for quick reference.</p><h3 id="building-all-servicestack-projects" tabindex="-1">Building All ServiceStack Projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#building-all-servicestack-projects" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Building all projects have also been simplified and can be run locally in both Windows and Unix platforms with the scripts below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/build/build-all.bat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build-all.bat</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/build/build-all.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build-all.sh</a></li></ul><p>Which runs the <strong>build.proj</strong> MS Build task in the <code>/build</code> folder of each top-level project. The difference between <strong>build.proj</strong> vs the <strong>.sln</strong> is that <strong>build.proj</strong> only builds the library projects deployed to NuGet which it locally copies into a <code>/NuGet</code> folder for easy access to locally modified packages.</p><h3 id="preserved-source-code-links" tabindex="-1">Preserved source code links <a class="header-anchor" href="#preserved-source-code-links" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>We&#39;ve fortuitously been able to benefit from GitHub&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/github/renaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renaming of their main branch</a> since all our repos were created before the change which allowed us to keep the existing structure in the earlier <strong>master</strong> branch untouched, preserving existing links whilst the new mono repo structure has been added in the new <strong>main</strong> branch which has now been switched over and become the <strong>default</strong> branch.</p><h3 id="switching-to-main-branch" tabindex="-1">Switching to main branch <a class="header-anchor" href="#switching-to-main-branch" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>If you&#39;ve previously checked out <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/main/ServiceStack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack</a> you will need to change the <strong>origin</strong> branch to use <strong>main</strong> however for simplicity we&#39;d recommend performing a clean checkout. You can also delete all other ServiceStack repos which are no longer maintained.</p><h3 id="why" tabindex="-1">Why? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>After dropping v4.5 .NET Framework support, deleting platform specific .NET 4.5 implementations &amp; removing legacy projects in our last major <a href="/releases/v6#breaking-changes">v6 Release</a>, we continued embarking on a journey to improve the health and approachability of our code base which up to this point was maintained across multiple repos, each encapsulating a stand-alone library that can be used independently. To enable much of its high level functionality the libraries make usage of core functionality in ServiceStack&#39;s common libraries.</p><h4 id="poor-cross-dependency-support" tabindex="-1">Poor cross dependency support <a class="header-anchor" href="#poor-cross-dependency-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>Actively developing cross-repo dependencies has always been a source of friction where previously to debug and maintain changes across all packages we&#39;ve had to maintain parallel <code>*.Source.csproj</code> for each project that used Project Source references instead of binary references which needed to be checked out and maintained in a separate physical location since .NET doesn&#39;t properly handle multiple <code>.csproj&#39;s</code> in the same folder. We were hoping support for source references for development and binary references for release would improve in time, however we gave up on this ever improving when the .NET team moved to a mono repo themselves.</p><h3 id="legacy-branches-and-releases" tabindex="-1">Legacy Branches and Releases <a class="header-anchor" href="#legacy-branches-and-releases" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>For
